# API Weather Dashboard
This repository contains a dynamic weather forecast application that provides real time weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for any location of your choice. The application features a clean and user-friendly interface for quick access to accurate weather updates. Whether you're planning your day or the week ahead, this app provides all the essential weather details in a user-friendly format.

The Weather Dashboard fetches data from a weather API to display:
